1. National Electrical Code (NEC) - NFPA 70
The NEC is widely used in the United States and provides standards for electrical installation, design, and safety. It covers grounding, wiring methods, and electrical equipment testing.
2. IEC Standards
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards, such as IEC 60364 for low-voltage installations and IEC 61557 for electrical safety testing, are used globally to ensure safety and performance in electrical systems.
3. IEEE Standards
IEEE develops standards for electrical and electronic systems, such as IEEE 1584 for electrical arc flash hazard analysis and IEEE 43 for insulation resistance testing of rotating machinery.
4. British Standards - BS 7671
This is the British Standard for electrical installation (commonly referred to as the "Wiring Regulations"), providing the requirements for electrical installations and safety tests.
5. OSHA Standards
In the U.S., OSHA provides guidelines on electrical safety, particularly in the workplace, as outlined in OSHA 29 CFR 1910 Subpart S, which covers electrical safety, testing, and inspections.
